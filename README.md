# Audit Assignments

A report plugin for Moodle that allows authorised users to audit the courses in which they have been granted permission
to verify that assignments are being set regularly in those courses.

## Permissions and Roles

This plugin will add a new capability. Users who should have access to audit assignments should be added to a role of your
creation which has this capability. Alternatively, add the capability to an existing defined role.
